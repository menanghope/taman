<p>According to the grievance, the note read: "This one is a professional. He's a Saudi that utilizes encryption ... We tracked him and found that 12 days ago he checked in once without encryption from IP [ redacted] at 18:40 UTC on 05/25/2015. This one does not use a cellular phone at all, just a browser. He's online right using Firefox form [sic] a windows machine."</p>
<p>Mr Alzabarah was faced by his supervisors and placed on administrative leave before running away to Saudi Arabia with his wife and daughter, investigators stated.</p>

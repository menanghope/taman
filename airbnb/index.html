<p>Airbnb states it will confirm every residential or commercial property on its platform after a news website found a series of frauds.</p>
<p>In October, Vice News uncovered a pattern of incorrect or deceptive property listings published on the leasings website.</p>
<p>Airbnb said it would evaluate every residential or commercial property by December 2020, and also guaranteed to refund customers if they were deceived by incorrect listings.</p>
<p>It is the very first time Airbnb, which introduced in 2008, has promised to confirm every house promoted on its platform.</p>
<p>Throughout its investigation, Vice News talked to numerous individuals who had actually reserved accommodation on Airbnb and been scammed.</p>
<p>When the guests showed up for their holiday, they usually got a last-minute telephone call from the proprietor saying the residential or commercial property was no longer readily available, due to an emergency situation or double-booking.</p>
<p>They would then be transferred to another residential or commercial property, often in a different area and without the features guaranteed in the initial booking.</p>
<p>In many cases the visitors felt they had no alternative but to remain at least one night, after showing up late during the night in a city far from house.</p>
<p>But they state Airbnb then declined to give them a complete refund regardless of the misleading bookings.</p>
<p>In a series of tweets, Airbnb chief executive Brian Chesky stated: "Airbnb remains in the business of trust. We are making the most considerable steps in creating trust on our platform since our original style in 2008."</p>
<p>He promised:</p>
<p>to review every house and host on Airbnb, intending to confirm every listing by December 2020
to reimburse visitors the entire expense of their reservation if the lodging does not meet "accuracy standards", and if the company can not find another home "that is simply as nice"
to launch a phone line so "anybody can call us any time, anywhere in the world and reach a genuine person"
Adam French, a customer rights expert from Which?, told the BBC: "Holiday booking scams is on the increase, with individuals losing millions every year to fraudsters tricking them out of their money with vacation lettings that do not actually exist.</p>
<p>" Steps from Airbnb to finally confirm all of its listings are positive, but the market should do more to make sure people are no longer being stripped of their money and having their vacation plans left in tatters."</p>
<p>On 2 November, Airbnb said it would ban "celebration houses" after a mass shooting at a California home rented through the company left 5 people dead.</p>
<p>And in 2017, it changed its security policy, after a BBC examination discovered lawbreakers were hijacking accounts and burgling houses.</p>

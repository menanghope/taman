<p>When nudged his one-year-old daughter over to work out how individuals balance, the manager of robotics business Boston Dynamics has confessed he.</p>
<p>A YouTube video of Marc Raibert's humanoid robot Atlas staying upright while being poked with hockey sticks has 34 million views.</p>
<p>He no longer knocked his robotics over just to show individuals they could get themselves back up once again, he said.</p>
<p>But when he had actually done so, it was due to the fact that he had actually felt like a "proud moms and dad".</p>
<p>" In reality, I have video of pressing on my child when she was one year old, knocking her over, getting some grief," he told BBC News, at Web Summit in Lisbon.</p>
<p>" She was teetering and tottering and finding out to balance and I simply wished to see what would happen. However we're still excellent buddies."</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics began by creating robots appropriate for military use but is now seeking to rent them to markets such as building and construction, gas and oil.</p>
<p>And Mr Raibert told BBC News he had actually had more than 3,500 queries about leasing its quadruped robotic, Spot - at the exact same cost as a luxury vehicle.</p>
<p>The business, which has yet to make a profit, was when owned by Google's parent, Alphabet, however has because been acquired by Japan's Softbank Group.</p>
<p>" If you look at our YouTube videos, it's always above a 95% thumbs-up from our followers," Mr Raibert informed BBC News.</p>
<p>" I take that as a sign people are favorable about what we are doing.</p>
<p>" When people see the robotics at conferences, they wish to take selfies, people want to pet the robotic.</p>
<p>" So that's a positive thing.</p>
<p>" On the other hand, if you check out the media, blogs and stories about our things, the words 'creepy' and 'scary' are in the titles and I 'd like to know if that's based upon any real details from the public."</p>
<p>Co-founder of Boston Dynamics Marc Raibert is typically at technology conferences, discussing his work
Mr Raibert himself when called his robots "nightmare-inducing", however - although he now says he was joking.</p>
<p>" I was teasing myself and the media when I stated it," he told BBC News.</p>
<p>" It was expected to be a closed meeting with no media and I was joking amongst a crowd of buddies. I was teasing us and them."</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics robotics are amongst the most advanced in the world - however for time being, the business is content with establishing "athletic intelligence" rather than integrating cognitive artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>When it comes to the progressively vocal argument about the how robots will work alongside human beings in future, Mr Raibert said others had more expertise.</p>
<p>" I'm interested in getting the robotics to do things," he said, "really functional things - movement dexterity, understanding worldwide so they can manoeuvre.</p>
<p>" Those are the essential functionalities that will make robotics helpful and intriguing."</p>
